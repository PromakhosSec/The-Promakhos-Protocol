# Day 1 – Initiation of The Promakhos Protocol

**Objective:**  
To become a high-impact cybersecurity professional, blending offensive security skills, AI leverage, and continuous evolution. The goal is not just to get certified — but to become dangerous, respected, and well-compensated.

**Today's Progress:**
- Set up GitHub Pages as my public learning journal ✅
- Completed the "Introduction to Cyber Security" room on TryHackMe
- Started researching CEH learning paths and resources

---

**Top 3 Learnings:**
1. Port scanning reveals service visibility and is fundamental to any initial recon phase.
2. TCP vs UDP: TCP's handshake gives more feedback, making it more useful for scanning.
3. Nmap is not a tool — it's a damn language. Learn it early, learn it deep.

**Next Steps:**
- Complete 2 more rooms on TryHackMe (Web Exploitation focus)
- Install local pentesting lab (Kali Linux + DVWA)
- Begin CEH Module 1 with full focus

**Reflection:**  
_"The start feels overwhelming — like staring at a black ocean with no map. But I’m not here to be safe. I’m here to become formidable."_
